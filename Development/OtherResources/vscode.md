### Keys will not repeat when held down

On OSX, there is an issue with Apple's "Press&Hold" feature, where you can select alternative characters on long presses.  This may interfere with auto-repeat for standard keys (which is very useful if you are using Vim emulation, for example).

You can disable this "feature" with a defaults command in the terminal:

```
defaults write NSGlobalDomain ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
```

You have to restart VSCode afterwards.

To reenable the previous behaviour:

```
defaults write NSGlobalDomain ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool true
```
