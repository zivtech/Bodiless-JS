# Documentation

In general each package should have information for installment and general usage in a README.md file.

Also process documentation and user documentation, should also be commited in packages in markdown files.

## Working with documentation

Markdown Resource: https://www.markdownguide.org/

### Documentation generation

One can generate documentation by running the `npm run docs` command. It will aggergate documentation from all packages and spin up a web interface to the docs at [http://localhost:3000/#/](http://localhost:3000/#/)

We are using [docsify](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify/) to generate a web interface, and custom tooling to compile the markdownfiles.

### How to document

If there is documentation that is specific to a package, then it should be include in the package as part of the readme for that package, or as seperate markdown files.
Each package can have a bodiless.docs.json file, that describes the structure and location of files.
For example if your package added a component it might have a bodiless.docs.json:

``` json
{
  "Component": {
    "FlashyComponent.md": "./README.md",
    "FlashyComponentScreenShot.png": "./FlashyComponentScreenShot.png"
  }
}
```

If your Package has lots of different files one can put them in a directory with the desired structure and then just reference the directory as such

``` json
{
  "_dir": "./doc",
}
```

#### If you are using files in the package.json

If you are using the key files in the package.json you need to make sure you add your docs.json file and any dir you are using to the package.json, such as:

``` json
{
...
  "files" {
    ...
    "/doc",
    "/bodiless.docs.json"
  }
...
}
```

This ensure that they are part of the package on release.

### Navbar and Sidebar

The Navbar and Sidebar will be autogenerated based on the structure presented. The
titles foe each item will be the keys in `bodiless.docs.json` (or the directory/file
names if using the `_dir` key).  These titles will be made a little more friendly
by
- stripping the `.md` suffix.
- convering PascalCase or snake_case to multiple words, eg:
  - "AboutUs.md" -> "About Us"
  - "npm_commands.md" -> "npm commands"

### Controlling the structure

Because documentation is assembled from different packages, the final order of items
can be hard to predict.  In order to control structure more precisely, you can create a 
`bodiless.docs.toc.json` file (this should reside at the to level of yoru project). The
format of this file is similar to that of the `bodiless.docs.json` file described above,
except that the values of each key should be blank. For example:
```json
{
	"About": {
		"GettingStarted.md": "",
	},
	"Components": {
	"Design": {},
	"Development": {
	"Tools": {},
}
```
This will ensure that the order of the top-level categories is fixed, and that the first
item in the "About" category is "GettingStarted.md". The contents of each category, as well
as the actual documentation to insert at "GettingStarted.md", will be determined by the
individual packages supplying documentation.  Thus, you can specify an order for the things
you care about, and let the documentation builder fill in the remaining documentaiton.

### Known issues

During execution of `npm run docs` command on Windows you may face issues with permissions to establish symlinks. To avoid this run Terminal as administrator.
